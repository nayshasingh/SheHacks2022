      <li>Brief History:</li>
      <p>The story of the birth of famous Rock Garden in Chandigarh dates back to 15th December 1924 when the mastermind as I
           see him, Nek Chand was born in Barian Kalan in Shakargarh, Gurdaspur District.It was then when famous French architect
           Le Corbusier was planning out the plan of the city. During this time the soon to be genius, Nek Chand got into the
            job of Road Inspector.This desire of finding something to express his talent led to collecting waste materials
             from demolition sites in and around the city. </p>

       <li>About:</li>
<p>  
     The Rock Garden is a massive open-air exhibition hall that displays sculptures made from urban and industrial wastes that
      have been designed and executed by Nek Chand. It also consists of man-made interlinked waterfalls. The popular Teej
      festival is also celebrated here each year. No matter who you are going to Chandigarh with, be it, family, friends or
       your loved one, make sure you include this in the list of your places to visit.

<h1 id="L7">7. Open Hand Monument </h1>
    <img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\SheHacks\Images\open.jpg" alt="Open Hand Monument">
     <ul type="square">

      <li>Brief History:</li>
      <p>The Open Hand became a public project rather than a private symbol when Le Corbusier planned it for the city of            Chandigarh, where his associate and cousin Pierre Jeanneret was then working as chief architect and town planning
        advisor to the Government of Punjab, and was supervising the construction of Chandigarh.Le Corbusier had discussed
      this project with the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru when he had visited India in 1951.</p>
       <li>About:</li>
<p>  
     It would be a sin to compare the Open hand Monument with any other monument of the world because Le Corbusier had a
     very strong reason to build such a monument, which is the official emblem of Chandigarh administration. The emblem
      for Chandigarh was designed to convey peace & reconciliation, and the unity of Mankind.
