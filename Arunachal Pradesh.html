      <h1>ARUNACHAL PRADESH</h1>
   
    <p>
        The literal meaning of Arunachal Pradesh is a “land of the dawn-lit mountains”. Located in the easternmost part of
         the Indian Territory, this wonderful holiday getaway is home to verdurous valleys, and unprecedented aestheticism.
          Gushing waterfalls, crystal clear lakes, and picturesque mountain tops enhance the astounding scenic beauty of this
           treasure trove of unmatched allure.
    </p>
    <p>October and April are the best months to visit Arunachal Pradesh which are the winter and the spring months for the
         state. Arunachal is located at a high altitude, and so has pleasant weather throughout the year. During the summers
          (April to June) temperature might be too high to explore during the peak daytime hours.</p>
