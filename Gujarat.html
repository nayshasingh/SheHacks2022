     <ul type="square">

      <li>Brief History:</li>
      <p>It’s said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold; this was rebuilt by Ravana in
         silver, by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone. The current serene, symmetrical structure was built to traditional
          designs on the original coastal site: it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large,
           black Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as jyotirlinga.</p>

       <li>About:</li>
<p>  
  The intricately carved honey-coloured Somnath temple on the western edge of the state is believed to be the place
  where the first of the twelve holy jyotirlingas emerged in India – a spot where Shiva appeared as a fiery column
   of light. The temples lies at the meeting of Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati rivers and the waves of the Arabian Sea
    ebb and flow touching the shore on which it is constructed. The ancient temple’s timeline can be traced from 649 BC
     but is believed to be older than that. The present form was reconstructed in 1951.
