    <img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\SheHacks\Images\chapora.jpg" alt="Chapora Fort">
     <ul type="square">

      <li>Brief History:</li>
      <p>The village of Chapora, and the fort, get their name from ‘Shahapura’ or, ‘the town of the Shah’. This was due to
           the fact that it was once the stronghold of the Sultanate of Bijapur. When the Portuguese defeated the Shah and 
           seized the fort, it had great military significance for them, as the Chapora river marked the northern boundary
            of Goa, with Pernem on it’s opposite bank, being the province of the Maharaja of Sawantwadi.</p>

       <li>About:</li>
<p>  
    There was once a church dedicated to St. Anthony that stood within the walls, however it is no longer standing.
    When the Portuguese rebuilt the fort in 1717, they added tunnels to allow to the fort’s defenders a safe retreat
     should their battlements be breached, a fortuitous decision as it turned out.
