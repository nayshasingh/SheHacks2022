    <p>
        The state owns the pride of establishing one among the first democracies in the world called Lichhavi. The earliest
         university in the world was established in Bihar. The name Bihar is a derivative from Vihara, which means ‘monastery’.
          True to its name and its rich cultural heritage, the state houses various monasteries and it is famous for monuments
           belonging to various religions.
    </p>
    <p>The weather in Bihar is scorching hot in summer which lasts from March till June. The best time to visit Bihar is
         either after the monsoon or before summer which is during October till March to get the most out of what the
          state has to offer.</p>
