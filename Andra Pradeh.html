      <h1>ANDHRA PRADESH</h1>
    
    <p>
        The versatile state of Andhra is the melting pot of both culture and historicity. It is the first state of India that
        was formed post linguistic independence of the country in the year 1953. And since its inception, it has been ahead
        in all forms of development. From the Tirumala temple to the Ahobilam forest, the hills in the ghats to the coast
         of Vizag, there are umpteen places to visit in Andhra Pradesh that are worth adding in your itinerary.
    </p>
    <p>Best time to visit Andhra Pradesh is during the winter season, i.e. between November and February when the weather is
     pleasant and comfortable for the tourists to visit all the tourist attractions. Andhra Pradesh is least recommended
      during summer as the temperature can hit a maximum of 45°C, making it an incredibly inconvenient option to travel
      to the state.</p>
