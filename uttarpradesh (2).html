<h1>DHAMEK STUPA SARNATH></h1>
<ing src="https://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Dhamek-Stupa-ili-33-img-1.jpg">
<p>After the death of King Buddha, his remains were buried in 10 locations including 8 mounds and
2 other mounds where ashes were buried in urn and coal. From these 10 sites, monuments
erected to commemorate the relics of the Buddha. Although due to a lack of relevant
information, it has been difficult to identify all the first ten mounds. However, Sarnath and
Sanchi appear to be extending the original dunes. Later, in 249 BCE, Mauryan King Ashoka
decreed that a monument of his own remains be preserved in the courtyard along with the rest of
the Buddha and his apostles. Not only that, he and his disciples spread Buddhism throughout the
region and throughout India.</p><br>
