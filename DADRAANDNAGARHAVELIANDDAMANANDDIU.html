        <li>About:</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Dating back to 1535 when Portuguese thought of staying India, they built this marvel. Standing still and portraying the greatness of Portugal rulers, this fort bathes in sunlight and glows in the moonlight and stays beside the enormous Arabian Sea each day. The existence of a huge lighthouse beside the fort adds another dimension to the panoramic view of the surrounding. The presence of various arms and the intelligence of Portuguese engineers have proved that strength is not always depicted by the existence of tangible substance but with the power of the mind. This brilliance of the engineers could be seen at the fort’s design. They used water for strengthening the fort’s base. This is a must visit spot for witnessing the panoramic view of the Arabian Sea.</li>

        <li>A former Portuguese colony, Silvassa is known for its scenic beauty, wildlife sanctuaries, beaches and facilities for water sports. Capital of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Silvassa lies between Gujarat and Maharashtra. Silvassa comprised 72 villages and was ruled by the Marathas till 1779. Later, it was offered to the Portuguese following a treaty. The many Roman-Catholic churches and stone walls stand testimony to the Portuguese rule as does the name Silvassa, which comes from the Portuguese word Silva or wood.</li>
