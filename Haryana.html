      <h1>HARYANA</h1>
    <p>
        Whether you are a believer in God or non-believer, ‘The Abode of God’, as Haryana is famously referred to, might make
     you think if there is a god, he might probably be here. The land is so ancient, which can be gauged by the fact that
     this was the place where Veda Vyasa, the saint, wrote the famous epic Mahabharata.
    </p>
    <p>October to March is the best time to visit Haryana owing to the favourable weather conditions during this time. It
         starts getting colder and pleasant around this time making it a perfect time for venturing out for sightseeing.</p>

         Buddhism. As mentioned in the travel account of the Chinese pilgrim Yuan Chwang, this place was adorned by many stupas
         and a monastery.During the reign of the Mauryan king Ashoka, the ancient city of Shrughna(modern Sugh) became an
          important center of Buddhism. </p>

       <li>About:</li>
<p>  
    To construct this baked brick stupa, concentric layers were put one over the other, each time leaving some space on the
     underlying layer, so that the whole structure should give a hemispherical look. Thus, this stupa corresponds to the
      Shahpur and Dharmarajika stupas at Taxila. At the top of the stupa, square space about 1.5 mt. was found filled with
       earth. This was the place for harmika which bore the chhatravali (umbrella).
