           Andaman and Nicobar islands. Constructed by the Britishers during their colonial rule in India, the jail was used
            particularly to exile Indian political prisoners. It was used to house many notable freedom fighters such as
             Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.</p>

      Andaman and Nicobar Islands where visitors can learn about its history and also enjoy a light show held in memory of
       all the prisoners who were imprisoned here.
